Title: Gift Registry
Group: Kevin Whalen, Kyle Meehan, Vidmantas Steponavicius

Description:
	The Gift Registry is meant to be a store independent way of simplifying gift 
	giving and receiving. The main advantage of having a personal registry like 
	this is being able to add items any time or place via internet. 

	It also makes gift giving a less complicated process. Friends do not have to go
	to any specific store and do not have to fabric gift ideas on their own. 

Example: 
	A user creates an event such as their birthday, then adds items that he/she would 	like to receive and invites people to the event. Those users who were invited 			will have option to confirm that they are coming or not and check off items from 		the gift list they will buy.
